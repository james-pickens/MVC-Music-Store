# MVC Music Store Sample App

This is a copy of the original MVC Music Store demo application from ~ 2010 that was built to demonstrate how to with the (at the time) new ASP.Net MVC framework.

You can find the full documentation on how to build this solution online on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1).

The purpose of this fork is to demonstrate how we can bring this solution to Windows Containers.
